                    <h2>Welcome to the NBA BudgetGM game!</h2>
                    <p>You have $15 to make the best possible NBA team with the listed players. You can pick any players from any category, as long as you select 5 total players and spend no more than $15. Once you've selected them, click on the "Simulate Season" button located next to your team's player pool. Everyday this pool will update, so come back tomorrow to compete to make the best team again!</p>
                    <p>Good luck!</p>

                    <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
                    <p>To make this game, I pulled data for hundreds of NBA players, inluding every player who averaged over 4 PPG, and programmatically gave them a rating between 0 and 100. I then divided them up into dollar categories based on that rating. The season is simulated using a model that adds wins to the chosen starting 5's season based on a range of stats. This model's coefficients used to add wins to a simulated season currently derives its coefficients from a combination of a linear regression model and trial and error simulation to give its projection, but I am always looking for ways to improve the model to give more realistic results.</p>
